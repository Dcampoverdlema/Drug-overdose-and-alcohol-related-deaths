```{r}
head(selected_data)
```

## alcohol-impaired deaths

```{r}
data_by_state <- selected_data |>
  filter(county_fips_code == "000")
```

## see the number of na's in the program (add these back)

```{r}
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
