## Introduction

Are there demographic and social factors that are predictors of drug overdose and alcohol-related incidents (e.g., driving accidents)?

## Data


## Methods



```{r} echo: false}

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
