## R Markdown

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)
library(broom)


```

```{r}
health_data <- read.csv("data/analytic_data2024.csv") |> 
  slice(-1) |>
  clean_names()


#glimpse(health_data)
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# looking only at state now
selected_data |>
  filter(county_fips_code=='000')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# issue with git?
# clustering analysis 
# alcohol impaired driving deaths
# x_female_raw_value is % female raw value 
# Q: what does the numerator and denominator mean vs the raw value more generally
# graphs that allow you to plot confidence intervals
# error in plotting the histogram for below

# for social factors--what amount median household income?
selected_data |>
  select(x_female_raw_value)
```

```{r}
health_data |>
  select(population_raw_value, population_numerator, population_denominator)

rawnum <- health_data |>
  select(v051_numerator)

```

```{r}
# Histogram for % Below 18 Years of Age
ggplot(selected_data, aes(x = )) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of % Below 18 Years of Age", x = "% Below 18 Years of Age", y = "Frequency")

# Histogram for % 65 and Older
ggplot(selected_data, aes(x = x_65_and_older_raw_value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "green", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of % 65 and Older", x = "% 65 and Older", y = "Frequency")

# Boxplot for % Below 18 Years of Age
ggplot(df, aes(x = "", y = v052_rawvalue)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of % Below 18 Years of Age", y = "% Below 18 Years of Age")

# Boxplot for % 65 and Older
ggplot(df, aes(x = "", y = v053_rawvalue)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "green", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of % 65 and Older", y = "% 65 and Older")
